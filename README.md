## Project Structure

This project is created using the Unity Engine version 2021.3.20f1. 
<br>
The project is seperated into 3 main categories:
- Assets
    - Contains all the assets and corresponding materials and textures. 
- Scenes
    - Contains the scenes for each feature/developer as to no cause unwanted merge conflicts.
- Scripts
    - Contains all the scripts for the features in the game.
<br>
Each of these folders are further organised into different sub-folders for ease of navigation.

## GitHub Structure

The GitHub is divided into several branched. 
<br>
The master branch is a one where we keep the most upto date version that is considered bug-free or when the team has crossed a milestone. 
<br>
The development branch is where all the team members merge and pull their work as to give access to the other members their work without going into another member's branch.
<br>
Each member has their own individual branch where they work on their user stories. This branch pull and merges from and into development.
<br>
This structure is to make sure that the a fault of a single member does not affect the whole project and consequently the entire team.

## How to Run The Project

In the Unity project file hierarchy, under the scenes folder there is a Master scene where all the features are integrated with each other and is the most complete version of the game.
